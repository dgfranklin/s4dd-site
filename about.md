Carnegie Mellonâ€™s Program for Deliberative Democracy (PDD) is helping to make Pittsburgh a national center for deliberative democracy. Through its work facilitating deliberative public engagement in communities throughout Pittsburgh, across the state, and across the country, the PDD builds strong ties between citizens and policymakers, developing connections that strengthen the voice of citizens in decision making processes.

With its newest initiative, Students for a Deliberative Democracy (S4DD), the Program is developing a core team of young deliberative practitioners who help make democracy strong. Deliberative practitioners promote inclusion, support informed citizen engagement, and connect citizen deliberations to decision making processes.

Members of Students for a Deliberative Democracy (S4DD) will:

* Learn from the people who are on the front lines, strengthening democracy in Pittsburgh and across the country
* Gain practical skills for supporting informed, inclusive, and impactful citizen engagement
* Connect to a national network of deliberative practitioners: students, scholars, community organizers, and public officials.
