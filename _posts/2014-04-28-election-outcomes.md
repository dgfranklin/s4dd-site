Next year's officers have been decided!  At our 4/28 general body meeting,
elections were held.  The new officers are:

* *President* - David Franklin
* *Vice President* - Mohammed Burny
* *Treasurer & Secretary* - Ashley Sobhani

We would also like to thank Lavender Yi, outgoing President, and Justin Mando,
outgoing liaison to the [Program for Deliberative Democracy](http://hss.cmu.edu/pdd/about/index.html)
for their incredible work this year in establishing our new organization.
